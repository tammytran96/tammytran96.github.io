I curated a mood board to capture elements that resonated with their vision. Initial sketches helped narrow down the style direction, leading to the creation of digital prototypes in Illustrator. Feedback and revisions were integral to refining the chosen design, ensuring it aligned with the client's expectations.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The color palette was meticulously crafted to complement the logo and reflect the brand's identity. Shades of green, mirroring the leaf's evolving hues in the logo, symbolize the company's journey and growth trajectory.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Takeaway</b><br></br>\n            My takeaway from this project is the power of collaboration and meaningful symbolism in design. Working closely with the client allowed me to understand their values, goals, and aesthetic preferences, which were crucial in creating a logo that truly represents their brand identity. The process of translating abstract concepts like progress, growth, and unity into visual elements reinforced the importance of thoughtful design and effective communication. This project taught me the art of balancing creativity with functionality, ensuring that the final product not only looks appealing but also conveys a meaningful message that resonates with the audience.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n    },\n    {\n      id: 3,\n      title: 'Misc.
